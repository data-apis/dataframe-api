Python dataframe API standard
=============================

.. note::

   This API standard is still a work in progress, and approaching "minimum
   viable product" status, where it's becoming possible to write library code
   against it that is dataframe-agnostic. Design discussions are
   happening in `this repository <https://github.com/data-apis/dataframe-api>`__.
   Participation there is very much welcome.
