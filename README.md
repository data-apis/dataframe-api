# Dataframe API standard

This repository contains documents, tooling and other content related to the
API standard for dataframes, and the dataframe interchange protocol.


## Dataframe API standard (draft)

This API is _draft and under development_, and moving towards an RFC status
where wider input from authors of dataframe and dataframe-consuming libraries
will be solicited. Those authors are the primary audience for this API, rather
than end users. Relevant content and links:

- [Dataframe API standard documentation](https://data-apis.org/dataframe-api/draft/index.html)


## Dataframe interchange protocol

This protocol is released and the specification should be considered stable. It
has implementations in multiple dataframe libraries (Pandas, cuDF, Modin, Vaex
at least). It may be extended and receive other necessary tweaks for things
discovered in the process of being adopted by a wider set of libraries.
